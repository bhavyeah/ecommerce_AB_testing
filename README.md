Project Overview:
This project analyzes an A/B test dataset to determine whether a new landing page performs better than the old one. We derive insights for product and business decisions using statistical tests, user segmentation, and time-based trend analysis.

Key Objectives:
1. A/B Testing & Conversion Rate Analysis 
- Conducted an A/B test to compare conversion rates between control and treatment groups.
- Result: No statistically significant difference found (p-value â‰ˆ 0.063).
2. Time-based Trend Analysis 
- Analyzed conversion trends over time to detect seasonal patterns or anomalies.
- Result: No major spikes/trends, suggesting uniform user behavior over time.
3. User Segmentation 
- Merged A/B test data with user country data to analyze conversion by region.
- Result: Identified regional differences in conversion rates, highlighting potential localization opportunities.
4. Product Analysis & Business Insights 
- Assessed whether user behavior varies based on country or landing page.
- Recommendation: Further testing is needed, especially region-specific optimizations.

Key Findings & Actionable Insights:
- The new landing page did not significantly outperform the old one, suggesting no need for immediate rollout.
- Some countries had higher conversion rates, indicating potential for regional personalization.
- No major time-based trends, meaning no seasonality effects on user engagement.

Next Steps:
- Conduct further A/B tests with localized page variations.
- Experiment with different CTA placements, messaging, and layouts for regional segments.
- Analyze additional factors (device type, user journey) to refine the conversion strategy.
